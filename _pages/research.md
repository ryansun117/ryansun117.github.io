My research experience comprises two projects, ASKEM and Marius, both of which involve work with data engineering, systems and databases, knowledge graphs, and machine learning. Below are details of each of them.

## Research Experience

* **ASKEM (Automating Scientific Knowledge Extraction Modeling)**, Sept 2022-Present
  * DARPAâ€™s [Automating Scientific Knowledge Extraction Modeling](https://www.darpa.mil/program/automating-scientific-knowledge-extraction-and-modeling) project: Developed RDF to relational entities conversion tool to extract entities from knowledge graphs and injected them into the [xDD](https://xdd.wisc.edu/) knowledgebase.
  * Improved the table extraction feature in [COSMOS](https://xdd.wisc.edu/); Indexed entities in xDD using a machine reading pipeline.
  * ASKEM, which aims to automate knowledge extraction from scientific models, is funded by DARPA and being developed by researchers at the Center for High Throughput Computing at UW-Madison, in collaboration with industry partners and other academic institutions.

* **Marius**, Sept 2021-May 2022
  * Developed Db2Graph, a database to knowledge graph conversion tool, as a feature for Marius. 
  * The [open-source repo](https://github.com/marius-team/marius) contains all source code, as well as Db2Graph [documentation](https://github.com/marius-team/marius/blob/main/docs/db2graph/db2graph.rst).
  * [Marius](https://marius-project.org/) is a framework for computing the embeddings of large-scale graphs on a single machine.
