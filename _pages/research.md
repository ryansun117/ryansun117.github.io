I am currently an undergraduate research assistant advised by Professor [Shivaram Venkataraman](https://shivaram.org/). My research experience consists of two projects, Marius and ASKEM, both of which involves work with data engineering, systems and databases, knowledge graphs, and machine learning. Below are details of each of them.

## Research Experience

* **Marius**, Sept 2021-May 2022
  * Developed Db2Graph, a database to knowledge graph conversion tool, as a feature for Marius. 
  * The [open-source repo](https://github.com/marius-team/marius) contains all source code, as well as Db2Graph [documentation](https://github.com/marius-team/marius/blob/main/docs/db2graph/db2graph.rst).
  * [Marius](https://marius-project.org/) is a framework for computing the embeddings of large-scale graphs on a single machine.

* **ASKEM (Automating Scientific Knowledge Extraction Modeling)**, Sept 2022-Present
  * Developed RDF to relational entities conversion tool to extract entities from knowledge graphs and injected them into the [xDD](https://xdd.wisc.edu/) knowledgebase.
  * Worked on using a machine reading pipeline to index on entities in xDD.
  * ASKEM aims to automate the knowledge extraction from scientific models. It is funded by DARPA and being worked on by researchers in Center for High Throughput Computing at UW-Madison, the indestry, and other academic institutions.
