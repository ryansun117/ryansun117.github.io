Welcome! I'm a 4-th year undergraduate student studying Computer Science and Mathematics at University of Wisconsin-Madison. I am currently an undergraduate research assistant advised by Professor [Shivaram Venkataraman](https://shivaram.org/). Previously, I interned at AWS Aurora in the summer of 2022 and at TDS Telecom from 2021 to 2022.

At school, I am a cellist in the All-University Strings Orchestra at UW-Madison. In my free time, I like lifting, yoga, bouldering, and hiking. My two pet peral-scale goldfishes.
