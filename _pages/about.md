Welcome! I'm a 4-th year undergraduate student studying Computer Science and Mathematics at University of Wisconsin-Madison. I am an undergraduate research assistant advised by Professor [Shivaram Venkataraman](https://shivaram.org/) in the [madSystems](https://madsystems.cs.wisc.edu/) group. Previously, I interned at AWS Aurora in the summer of 2022 and at TDS Telecom from 2021 to 2022, and contributed to the [Marius project](https://marius-project.org/) led by Professor Theodoros Rekatsinas and Shivaram Venkataraman.

At school, I am a cellist in the All-University Strings Orchestra at UW-Madison. In my free time, I like lifting, yoga, climbing, and hiking. [My two pet peral-scale goldfishes](/images/fishy.jpg).
